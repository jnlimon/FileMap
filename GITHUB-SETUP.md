# GitHub Setup Guide

Your Research Manager Desktop App is now ready to be pushed to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## 🚀 Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Choose a repository name (e.g., "research-manager-desktop-app")
5. Make it public or private (your choice)
6. **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 🔗 Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Set the main branch as upstream
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 📝 Step 3: Verify Everything is Pushed

```bash
# Check remote status
git remote -v

# Check if everything is up to date
git status
```

## 🔄 Step 4: Future Updates

When you make changes to your code:

```bash
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Description of your changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```
